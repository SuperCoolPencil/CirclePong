I was bored of loading screens.
> Waiting for builds. Waiting for fetches. Waiting for installs.

So I made CirclePong (while waiting ðŸ˜‚)

> Play it yourself or watch it play automatically.

## Overview

CirclePong is a reinterpretation of the classic Pong game, played on a circular field. Paddles move along the circumference of a circle, deflecting a ball that has to remain within the circle!

## Gameplay

* Players control a paddle moving on the circleâ€™s circumference.
* Players bounce the ball back by aligning their paddle with the ballâ€™s position.
* Missing the ball results in a score loss
